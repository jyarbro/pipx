# pipx Scripts

This is a monorepo containing my custom pipx-installed command-line tools.

Each tool lives in its own directory with a pyproject.toml and a main entrypoint.

## Included

— download videos using yt-dlp
— move Proton prefixes to native filesystem with symlinks
— delete old kernel versions safely
