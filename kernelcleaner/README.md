# kernelcleaner

`kernelcleaner` is a simple command-line tool that removes old Linux kernel versions to help keep your system clean and reclaim disk space.

Built for use with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx), it safely keeps the currently running kernel and the most recently installed one, while offering clear output on what it's doing.
